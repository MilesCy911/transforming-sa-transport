**Disclaimer**

This project is a conceptual, data-driven portfolio created to demonstrate strategic thinking, analytical skills, and design capabilities in the context of public transport reform in South Africa.

While I am deeply passionate about improving mobility, safety, and equity through better infrastructure, please note:

- Some of the data presented is **mock data**, generated to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Visualizations are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities — **not journalistic or academic findings**.
- All analysis is based on **publicly available insights, personal observation, and policy logic**, rather than commissioned research.

This portfolio should be viewed as a **skills showcase and strategic proposal**, not a verified data report.
