# 🚆 Transforming South African Transport Through Design, Culture & Policy

### A people-first public transport vision to reduce congestion, empower local businesses, and save lives.

---

## 🧭 Overview

South Africa faces a growing transport crisis:

- 🚗 Roads are overcrowded.
- 🚨 Drunk driving remains high despite law enforcement.
- 🅿️ Urban space is increasingly consumed by cars and parking.
- 🚉 Trains are underused, neglected, and socially stigmatized.

This project outlines a holistic, data-informed proposal to **revitalize public transport**, with a focus on **rail infrastructure**, **urban design**, and **cultural transformation**.

---

## 🎯 Key Proposal

### 1. **Redesign Train Stations as Social Hubs**
- Clean, modern, well-lit spaces
- Local cafés, street food, kiosks, and art spaces
- 24/7 operation to match real-world social behavior

### 2. **Ban Big Chains From Operating in Stations**
- No McDonald's, KFC, or other major franchises
- Prioritize **independent local vendors and SMEs**
- Reduce monopolization, stimulate township-to-city entrepreneurship

*Exception: At flagship stations such as Cape Town CBD and Bellville, select hight-quality national brands may be allowed to operate alongside small vendors to maintain a premium, high footfall environment

## 🎁 The Outcomes

✅ **Job Creation**  
By reserving vendor spaces for locals, we ensure economic upliftment from the ground up.

✅ **Reduced Road Congestion**  
With trains running 24/7 and stations being safe and desirable, more commuters — across all income levels — will leave their cars at home.

✅ **Drunk Driving Prevention**  
Law enforcement alone hasn’t worked. Infrastructure that gives people **better options at night** is the smartest prevention strategy.

✅ **Cultural Rebranding of Trains**  
From a "poor person’s transport" to an attractive, inclusive option for everyone — backed by vibrant visuals, campaigns, and community ownership.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

South Africa cannot continue expanding its car-centric infrastructure. If we don’t act now:

- Parking space will cannibalize commercial and residential land.
- Cities will become increasingly unequal and unlivable.
- Congestion and DUI-related fatalities will continue to rise.

> **Transport is not just about moving people. It’s about shaping society.**
